# Questions
Answer these questions and for each question explain your reasoning in one line. 


1. *(2 points)* What actions can we take to ensure the tests in the Test Driven Development contain no mistakes?
  
    ANSWER: Add more test cases or check whether the coverage of test cases is 100%.
  
2. *(2 points)* Assume all the requirements are covered by the unit tests, why this still does not 
guarantee an error-free execution of the program? (Hint: you can get some inspiration from the 
investigations of failed space missions) 
  
    ANSWER: Special input and edge conditions.

3. *(2 points)* What other code metrics besides test coverage can be used to evaluate the quality 
of the source code?

    ANSWER: Time complexity, space complexity, and cyclomatic complexity.

4. *(2 points)* Based on the description of the matrix multiplication problem, approximately how many elements 
would be non zero, as a function of ``n``, in the multiplication result matrix? (Note, matrices have the 
dimension of ``n`` by ``n`` and with the elements independent and identically distributed with a probability 
of 0.9 to be 0 and a probability of 0.1 to be non zero)

    ANSWER: Expectation is [1-pow(0.99, n)]*n^2

5. *(2 points)* Same question but for the matrix addition operation?

    ANSWER: Expectation is 0.01*n^3
