Answer these questions and for each question explain your reasoning in one line. 
You will receive 1 point for the correct answer and 1 point for the correct reasoning.


1. (2 points) After starting a Linux program using the terminal, the program stopped responding. 
What do you do to interrupt its execution? (Note, no graphical interface is available)

ANSWER: Ctrl+C
It kill a process with the signal SIGINT.


2. (2 points) After starting a Linux program in the background using the terminal (appending & to 
a command instructs Linux to run it in the background and return the terminal control), the program 
stopped responding. What procedure can you use to interrupt the program execution? 
(Note, no graphical interface is available)

ANSWER: ps + kill
Use ps to list all the processes, and kill certain program with its number.


3. (2 points) What is the algorithmic complexity O(?) of your matrix multiplication program assuming 
all matrices have dimension n by n and the algorithmic complexity of reading and writing an element 
to file is O(1)?

ANSWER: O(n^3)
I will get a result matrix with dimension n by n, and for each element, I need to calculate O(n) times, so the computation process complexity is O(n^3). For reading and writing process, the time complexity is O(n^2). So the total time complexity T(n) = O(n^3).
It can be faster usign divide and conquer, but I donot use in this program. 


4. (2 points) What is the algorithmic complexity O(?) of your matrix multiplication program assuming 
all matrices have dimension n by n and the algorithmic complexity of reading and writing an element 
to file is O(n), i.e., proportional with the number of columns in the matrix?

ANSWER:O(n^3)
The computation complexity is also O(n^3) as above. The reading and writing process complexity will be O(n*n*(n-1)/2)=O(n^3). So the total complexity is also O(n^3)


5. (2 points) Given that only r = 0.1 (10%) of the matrix elements are non-zero, what can you do to 
improve your algorithm. What is the algorithmic complexity O(?) for the average case of this new matrix 
multiplication program expressed in terms of r and n assuming all matrices have dimension n by n and 
the algorithmic complexity of reading and writing an element to file is O(1)? 
(Note, limit your answer to 50 words.)

ANSWER:O(n^2)
We can construct hashmap<k,(x,val)> A, and hashtable<k,(y,val)> B to represent the coordinates of the non-zero points in A and B. Then we traversal to find the same k to calculate non-zero result. There are O(n^2) non-zero points, so the computation complexity is O(n^2). The reading and writing complexity is also O(n^2). In result, the total complexity is O(n^2).
